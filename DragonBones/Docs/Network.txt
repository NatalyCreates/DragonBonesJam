OVERVIEW:
1. A match is made between two players
2. One of the players (the master client, for whom PhotonNetwork.isMasterclient == true is selected as host
3. The host generates generates an RNG seed and sends it to the client. This is the host's sole responsibility.
4. Each player deterministically generates the map using this seed.
while game is not over:
	5. Players take their turns locally. Their inputs are logged. [1]
	6. Players exchange inputs, and run each other's turns locally. So each player has a complete copy of the game, updating in lockstep.
	
	
[1] In one design, players immediately see the consequences of their actions, therefore  players' experiences might disagree on the final turn of the game (each would see him/herself dig out tile X, and only _then_ see the other player dig out the same tile). Resources gained during the final turn would probably be retroactviely lost.
